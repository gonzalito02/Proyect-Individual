## Resume
As you can see, i have to do a store of Pokemon!. The minimum features that we had to develop are a display to show all the cards (in this case, of pokemons) a paginated to go back
or fordward throug all the pages whit the cards, create pokemons, filters, and more.

#### All the work has done using JavaScript, CSS and HTML!

## Tools

For do this project, the tasks to do were:

 - Connect whit and extern API (PokeApi)
 - Make all the logic in the backend, using Express, Sequelize and PostgresSQL, that includes manipulate data from the API to make it usefull to display it. 
 - Make the Redux system, all components whit React, and all the features demanded for a correct display.
 - The styles over all the page and every route.

I was able to complete all those requirements, searching information and learning new tools!
